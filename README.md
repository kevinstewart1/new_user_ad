  Step 2:
  <br /> 
  I want to create a new user called Alex. To do that, iâ€™ll click on the example (local) entry. This is the entry for the domain that my account can manage. Then scroll down and double click on the Users entry to see the list of users and groups that currently exist. <br/>

Step 3: Adding the New User
<br/>
To create a new user, take a look at the tasks list on the right. Under the Users section, there's a New menu entry, which opens a submenu to select what's the type of entity that you want to create. In this case, we want to create a new user, so click on the User option.

<br/>
Step 4:
<br/>
This will open a new window that lets you fill in a number of fields related to the new user. There are a lot of fields available, but only a couple are mandatory (indicated with the red star). You can leave the rest empty. The user that we are creating is called Alex, with their username being also alex. <br/>

<br/>
Step 5:
<br/>
The system will not enable an account that doesn't have a good password. In this case, the password is empty because we haven't set it. Obviously, an empty password is not a good password. You can set a password using the Reset password menu option. <br/>

<br/>
Step 6:
<br/>
Enter the password and confirm password into the Reset Password window, and User must change password at next logon option is already checked, we ensure that the user will change their password when they log in. So now click on the OK button to set the password. The goal of this is that after they've logged in once, the system administrator will not know their new password. <br/>
